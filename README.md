2+ examples of things you enjoyed about or learned from this project
1) Lily- I feel like I had retained a lot more than I thought I had, so knowing what to search made everything all the better. I also enjoyed working with Alec, a character he is.

2) Alec - I personally really enjoyed seeing everything come together and working with Lily. I feel like we both knew certain pieces and it allowed us to get a lot done in the time we had together.


2+ examples of things you didn’t enjoy or wanted to learn from this project
1) Lily - I think I had a hard time with realizing dumb mistakes, but loved that when I found the answer to it, I remembered it happening in a past project and knew how to fix the error.

2) Alec - I didn't enjoy feeling stressed about it over Thanksgiving break, but Lily was great about keeping me updated on the plan and I made sure to make myself available to work together this week.
